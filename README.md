# Smart-solution-for-traffic-management-system
using YOLO Algorithm
-	Description: Using OpenCV library in python for traffic management
-	It employs image processing techniques, including object detection using YOLO for vehicle detection. The system incorporates algorithms to calculate traffic density and dynamically adjusts green signal timers accordingly, aiming to optimize traffic flow and improve efficiency.
-	Technology: Image processing, object detection, YOLO is used for vehicle detection, and the system uses algorithms to calculate traffic density and set green signal timers.
